## Where to Find the Serial Number Date Code on Your Smith and Wesson Firearm
  
The serial number date code on your Smith and Wesson firearm is usually engraved on the frame, under the yoke (the metal piece that connects the barrel to the cylinder). On some models, however, the serial number may be found on the side of the frame, on the cylinder, on the crank, or on the rear of the pistol. You can contact Smith and Wesson's customer service department if you need help locating the serial number for your firearm. You can also visit their website and use their "Serial Number Lookup" tool to register your firearm and access information about it.
  
## How to Interpret the Serial Number Date Code on Your Smith and Wesson Firearm
  
The serial number date code on your Smith and Wesson firearm consists of a letter prefix followed by a series of numbers. The letter prefix indicates the model or series of your firearm, while the numbers indicate the year or range of years that your firearm was manufactured. For example, a serial number starting with V means that your firearm is a Victory model, which was produced from 1942 to 1945 for military use during World War II. A serial number starting with SV means that your firearm is a post-war Victory model with some modifications. A serial number starting with S means that your firearm is a Military & Police revolver, which was produced from 1945 to 1970.
  
Some of the common letter prefixes used by Smith and Wesson are:
  
- V: Victory model (1942-1945)
- SV: Post-war Victory model (1945-1948)
- S: Military & Police revolver (1945-1970)
- C: K-frame revolver (1948-1983)
- D: Airweight revolver (1952-1969)
- J: Small frame revolver (1950-present)
- K: Medium frame revolver (1899-present)
- L: Large frame revolver (1980-present)
- N: Large frame magnum revolver (1960-present)
- R: Centennial Airweight revolver (1952-present)
- T: Target model revolver (1926-1986)
- W: World War II military revolver (1940-1945)

The numbers following the letter prefix indicate the year or range of years that your firearm was manufactured. However, these numbers are not always sequential or consistent, as Smith and Wesson sometimes used overlapping serial numbers for different models or series. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a reliable reference source, such as the Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson by Supica and Nahas, to verify the exact year of manufacture for your firearm. You can also use online resources, such as Recoil Review or Optics Bible, to access tables of manufacture dates based on serial numbers.
